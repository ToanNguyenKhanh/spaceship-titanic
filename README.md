# Introduction:

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook named "spaceship-titanic.ipynb". This notebook analyzes the Titanic dataset using machine learning techniques.

# Dataset:

The dataset used in this notebook is the famous Titanic dataset, which describes information about passengers and crew on the Titanic, including name, age, gender, social class, etc.

# Methods:

# The notebook uses the following machine learning methods:

    Linear regression: Predicts the survival rate based on independent variables such as age, gender, and social class.
    Decision tree: Classifies passengers into survivors and non-survivors based on independent variables.

# Results:

The notebook presents the results of analyzing the Titanic dataset using machine learning methods, including:

    Accuracy of the models
    Importance of independent variables
    Factors affecting the survival rate

# Instructions:

To use this notebook, you need to install Python and Jupyter Notebook. Then, you can download the notebook from this repo and run it in Jupyter Notebook.

# Note:

This notebook is for research and learning purposes only.
